Developed a complex web application, "Corner of Good Food," using the MEAN stack. The site supports three user roles: guest, waiter, and admin, each with distinct pages and functionalities.

Guests can make reservations via a form or interactive canvas, order food for delivery, review restaurants, and access many more features. Waiters can manage reservations and orders and access restaurant performance statistics. Admins have comprehensive control over managing waiter and guest accounts, adding new restaurants (including drawing layouts on a canvas), and updating the menu.
